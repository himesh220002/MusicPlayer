  'Eminem-Beautiful-Pain': `'I can feel the heat risin'
  Everything is on fire
  Today is a painful reminder
  Of why we can only get brighter
  The further you put it behind ya
  But right now I'm on the inside
  Lookin' out, 'cause
  I'm standin' in the flames
  It's a beautiful kind of pain
  Settin' fire to yesterday
  Find the light, find the light, find the light
  I'm standin' in the flames
  It's a beautiful kind of pain
  Settin' fire to yesterday
  Find the light, find the light, find the light
  Yesterday was the tornado warning
  Today's like the morning after
  Your world is torn in half
  You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
  And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
  Today's a whole new chapter
  It's like an enormous asthma
  Thunderstorm has passed ya
  You weathered it and poked its eye out with the thornbush that ya
  Used to smell the roses
  Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
  Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
  And hit the corner faster, more assertive
  Never looking back, may hit the curb
  But every day is a new learning curve as you steer through life
  Sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
  To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
  'Cause they hurt you so bad
  It's like they murdered your ass
  And threw dirt on your casket
  But you've returned from the ashes
  And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
  And while you're burning the past
  Standing at inferno and chant
  I'm standin' in the flames
  It's a beautiful kind of pain
  Settin' fire to yesterday
  Find the light, find the light, find the light
  I'm standin' in the flames
  It's a beautiful kind of pain
  Settin' fire to yesterday
  Find the light, find the light, find the light
  You're so familiarized
  With what having to swallow this pill is like
  It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
  And it's as though you feel you've died
  'Cause you've been killed inside
  But yet you're still alive
  Which means you will survive
  Although today you may weep 'cause you're weak and
  Everything seems so bleak and
  Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
  It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
  You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
  And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
  And with a little time that should do the healing
  And by tomorrow, you may even feel so good that you're willing
  To forgive 'em, even after all the shit you been put through
  This feeling of resilience is building
  And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building
  You're sealed in, but you're fireproof
  Flame retardant, you withstood it
  And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'
  You look down, 'cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
  As time passes, things change every day
  But wounds, wounds heal
  But scars still remaining the same
  But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
  Throw the match, set the past ablaze
  So feel the fire beneath your feet
  As you barely even perspire from the heat
  Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
  And as you say goodbye to the grief
  It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
  But you've extinguished this livin' hell
  Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream
  I'm standin' in the flames
  It's a beautiful kind of pain
  Settin' fire to yesterday
  Find the light, find the light, find the light
  I'm standin' in the flames
  It's a beautiful kind of pain
  Settin' fire to yesterday
  Find the light, find the light, find the light
  I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
  Rising, a phoenix from the flames
  I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
  It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly
  And I'm standin' in the flames
  It's a beautiful kind of pain
  Settin' fire to yesterday
  Find the light, find the light, find the light
  I'm standin' in the flames
  It's a beautiful kind of pain
  Settin' fire to yesterday
  Find the light, find the light, find the light'`,

  'Taylor_Swift_-_Blank_Space': `'Nice to meet you, where you been?
  I could show you incredible things
  Magic, madness, heaven, sin
  Saw you there and I thought
  "Oh, my God, look at that face
  You look like my next mistake
  Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay
  New money, suit and tie
  I can read you like a magazine
  Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
  And I know you heard about me
  So hey, let's be friends
  I'm dying to see how this one ends
  Grab your passport and my hand
  I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
  So it's gonna be forever
  Or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over, mm
  If the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  'Cause you know I love the players
  And you love the game
  'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
  We'll take this way too far
  It'll leave you breathless, mm
  Or with a nasty scar
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  But I've got a blank space, baby
  And I'll write your name
  Cherry lips, crystal skies
  I could show you incredible things
  Stolen kisses, pretty lies
  You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
  Find out what you want
  Be that girl for a month
  Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
  Screaming, crying, perfect storms
  I can make all the tables turn
  Rose garden filled with thorns
  Keep you second guessing like
  "Oh, my God, who is she?"
  I get drunk on jealousy
  But you'll come back each time you leave
  'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
  So it's gonna be forever
  Or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over, mm
  If the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  'Cause you know I love the players
  And you love the game
  'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh)
  We'll take this way too far
  It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)
  Or with a nasty scar
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
  But I've got a blank space, baby
  And I'll write your name
  Boys only want love if it's torture
  Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
  Boys only want love if it's torture
  Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
  So it's gonna be forever
  Or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over (over)
  If the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
  'Cause you know I love the players
  And you love the game
  'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
  We'll take this way too far (ooh)
  It'll leave you breathless, mm
  Or with a nasty scar (leave a nasty scar)
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  But I've got a blank space, baby
  And I'll write your name'`,

  'Taylor-Swift-22' :`'It feels like a perfect night
  To dress up like hipsters
  And make fun of our exes
  Ah-ah, ah-ah
  It feels like a perfect night
  For breakfast at midnight
  To fall in love with strangers
  Ah-ah, ah-ah
  Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
  It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
  Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
  It's time, oh-oh
  I don't know about you
  But I'm feeling 22
  Everything will be alright if
  You keep me next to you
  You don't know about me
  But I'll bet you want to
  Everything will be alright if
  We just keep dancing like we're 22, 22
  It seems like one of those nights
  This place is too crowded
  Too many cool kids
  (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew) Ah-ah, ah-ah
  It seems like one of those nights
  We ditch the whole scene
  And end up dreamin' instead of sleeping, yeah
  We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
  It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
  Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
  It's time, oh-oh
  I don't know about you
  But I'm feeling 22
  Everything will be alright if
  You keep me next to you
  You don't know about me
  But I'll bet you want to
  Everything will be alright if
  We just keep dancing like we're 22 (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
  22
  I don't know about you
  22, 22
  It feels like one of those nights
  We ditch the whole scene
  It feels like one of those nights
  We won't be sleeping
  It feels like one of those nights
  You look like bad news
  I gotta have you
  I gotta have you
  Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
  I don't know about you
  But I'm feeling 22
  Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
  You keep me next to you
  You don't know about me
  But I'll bet you want to
  Everything will be alright if
  We just keep dancing like we're 22
  22 (Dancing like)
  22 (Yeah, yeah)
  22 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
  It feels like one of those nights
  We ditch the whole scene
  It feels like one of those nights
  We won't be sleeping
  It feels like one of those nights
  You look like bad news
  I gotta have you
  I gotta have you'` ,

  'Taylor-Swift-White-Horse' : `'Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
  Comes out just when you need it to
  As I paced back and forth all this time
  'Cause I honestly believed in you
  Holdin' on, the days drag on
  Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known
  That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
  I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
  Lead her up the stairwell
  This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
  I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
  Now it's too late for you and your white horse
  To come around
  Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
  And never really had a chance
  My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
  You had to fight to have the upper hand
  I had so many dreams about you and me
  Happy endings, now I know
  I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
  I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
  Lead her up the stairwell
  This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
  I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
  Now it's too late for you and your white horse
  To come around
  And there you are on your knees
  Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
  Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
  'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
  I'm gonna find someone someday
  Who might actually treat me well
  This is a big world, that was a small town
  There in my rear-view mirror disappearing now
  And it's too late for you and your white horse
  Now it's too late for you and your white horse
  To catch me now
  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
  Try and catch me now, oh
  It's too late
  To catch me now'`

  "Linkin Park - Numb":`"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
  Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
  Don't know what you're expecting of me
  Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
  (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
  Every step that I take is another mistake to you
  (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
  I've become so numb
  I can't feel you there
  Become so tired
  So much more aware
  I'm becoming this
  All I want to do
  Is be more like me
  And be less like you
  Can't you see that you're smothering me
  Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
  'Cause everything that you thought I would be
  Has fallen apart right in front of you
  (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
  Every step that I take is another mistake to you
  (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
  And every second I waste is more than I can take
  I've become so numb
  I can't feel you there
  Become so tired
  So much more aware
  I'm becoming this
  All I want to do
  Is be more like me
  And be less like you
  And I know
  I may end up failing too
  But I know
  You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
  I've become so numb
  I can't feel you there
  Become so tired
  So much more aware
  I'm becoming this
  All I want to do
  Is be more like me
  And be less like you
  I've become so numb
  I can't feel you there
  (I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
  I've become so numb
  I can't feel you there
  (I'm tired of being what you want me to be)"`

  "Linkin Park - Now I See":`" I woke up in a dream today to the cold of the static
  And put my cold feet on the floor
  (Forgot all about yesterday)
  Rememberin' I'm pretendin' to be where I'm not anymore
  (A little taste of hypocrisy)
  And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
  (Even though you're so close to me)
  You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back
  It's true, the way I feel
  Was promised by your face
  The sound of your voice
  Painted on my memories
  Even if you're not with me
  I'm with you
  (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
  With you
  (You, now, I see, even when I close my eyes)
  (I hit you and you hit me back)
  We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
  (Fine line between this and that)
  When things go wrong, I pretend that the past isn't real
  (I'm trapped in this memory)
  And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
  (So even though you're close to me)
  You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back
  It's true, the way I feel
  Was promised by your face
  The sound of your voice
  Painted on my memories
  Even if you're not with me
  I'm with you
  (You, now, I see, keepin' everything inside)
  With you
  (You, now, I see, even when I close my eyes)
  With you
  (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
  With you
  (You, now, I see, even when I close my eyes)
  No, no matter how far we've come
  I can't wait to see tomorrow
  No matter how far we've come
  I, I can't wait to see tomorrow
  With you
  (You, now, I see, keepin' everything inside)
  With you
  (You, now, I see, even when I close my eyes)
  With you
  (You, now I see, keepin' everything inside)
  With you

  "Linkin Park - One Step Closer":`" I cannot take this anymore
  Saying everything I've said before
  All these words, they make no sense
  I find bliss in ignorance
  Less I hear, the less you say
  You'll find that out anyway
  Just like before
  Everything you say to me
  (Takes me one step closer to the edge)
  (And I'm about to break)
  I need a little room to breathe
  ('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
  (I'm about to break)
  I find the answers aren't so clear
  Wish I could find a way to disappear
  All these thoughts they make no sense
  I find bliss in ignorance
  Nothing seems to go away
  Over and over again
  Just like before
  Everything you say to me
  (Takes me one step closer to the edge)
  (And I'm about to break)
  I need a little room to breathe
  ('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
  (I'm about to break)
  Everything you say to me
  (Takes me one step closer to the edge)
  (And I'm about to break)
  I need a little room to breathe
  ('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge)
  (And I'm about to-)
  Break, break, break...
  Shut up when I'm talking to you
  Shut up, shut up, shut up
  Shut up when I'm talking to you
  Shut up, shut up, shut up
  Shut up
  I'm about to break
  Everything you say to me
  (Takes me one step closer to the edge)
  (And I'm about to break)
  I need a little room to breathe
